          creating a list of the greatest games of all time. Instead of relying on a predetermined ranking by journalists, they invited a
          diverse group of industry professionals and enthusiasts to submit their personal top ten lists. A total of 239 final lists were
          received from 300 participants, resulting in 652 different games receiving votes. The list includes a mix of well-known classics,
          surprising newcomers like Disco Elysium, and the absence of popular franchises like Assassin's Creed. The winner not only received
          the most votes but also ranked as many people's number one choice. The full list represents various stories and features games
